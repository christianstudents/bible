  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> But I determined this for myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> For if I cause you sorrow, who then is the one who makes me glad, except the one who is made sorrowful by me?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I wrote this very thing to you that when I come I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice, having confidence in you all that my joy is the joy of you all.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you would be made sorrowful but that you would know the love which I have more abundantly toward you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But if anyone has caused sorrow, he has not caused me to sorrow, but in part (lest I lay too heavy a burden) all of you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Sufficient for such a one is this punishment by the majority,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> So that on the contrary you should rather forgive and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with excessive sorrow.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Therefore I exhort you to confirm your love toward him.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For to this end also I wrote, that I might know your approvedness, whether you are obedient in all things.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But whom you forgive anything, I also forgive; for also what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, it is for your sake in the person of Christ;<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> That we may not be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> Furthermore, when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and a door was open to me in the Lord,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> I had no rest in my spirit, for I did not find Titus my brother; but taking leave of them, I went forth into Macedonia.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in the Christ and manifests the savor of the knowledge of Him through us in every place.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> For we are a fragrance of Christ to God in those who are being saved and in those who are perishing:<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> To some a savor out of death unto death, and to the others a savor out of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For we are not like the many, adulterating the word of God for profit; but as out of sincerity, but as out of God, before God we speak in Christ. <br><br>
