  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> It is actually reported that there is fornication among you, and such fornication that does not even occur among the Gentiles, that someone has his stepmother.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And you are puffed up? And have you not rather mourned, that the one who has done this deed might be removed from your midst?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For I, on my part, though being absent in the body but present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you and my spirit have been assembled, with the power of our Lord Jesus,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of his flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> So then let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> I wrote to you in my letter not to mingle with fornicators,<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> But not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous and rapacious, or idolaters, since then you would have to go out of the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But now I have written to you not to mingle with anyone who is called a brother, if he is a fornicator or a covetous man or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or a rapacious man, with such a one not even to eat.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For what have I to do with judging those who are outside the church? Do you not judge those who are within the church?<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> But those who are outside, God will judge. Remove the evil man from among yourselves. <br><br>
