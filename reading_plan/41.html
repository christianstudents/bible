  <h4 id="galatians-1"><a onclick="open_chapter('top', '48-galatians.html')">Galatians 1</a></h4>
  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised Him from the dead),<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> And all the brothers who are with me, to the churches of Galatia:<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Who gave Himself for our sins that He might rescue us out of the present evil age according to the will of our God and Father,<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> To whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> I marvel that you are so quickly removing from Him who has called you in the grace of Christ to a different gospel,<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Which is not another gospel, only there are some who trouble you and desire to pervert the gospel of Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But if even we or an angel out of heaven should announce to you a gospel beyond that which we have announced to you, let him be accursed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> As we have said before, now also I say again, If anyone announces to you a gospel beyond that which you have received, let him be accursed.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> For am I now trying to win the assent of men or of God? Or am I seeking to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a slave of Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For I make known to you, brothers, concerning the gospel announced by me, that it is not according to man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation by Jesus Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For you have heard of my manner of life formerly in Judaism, that I persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries in my race, being more abundantly a zealot for the traditions of my fathers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But when it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me through His grace,<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> To reveal His Son in me that I might announce Him as the gospel among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia and again returned to Damascus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and I remained with him fifteen days.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the brother of the Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Now concerning the things which I am writing to you, behold, before God, I am not lying.<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Yet I was still unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which are in Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> But they only heard this: He who was formerly persecuting us is now announcing as the gospel the faith which formerly he ravaged.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And they glorified God because of me. <br><br>
