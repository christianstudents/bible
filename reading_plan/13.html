  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to fleshy, as to infants in Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it. But neither yet now are you able,<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For you are still fleshly. For if there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly and do you not walk according to the manner of man?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> For when someone says, I am of Paul, and another, I of Apollos, are you not men of flesh?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> What then is Apollos? And what is Paul? Ministers through whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to each one of them.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused the growth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For we are God’s fellow workers; you are God’s cultivated land, God’s building.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each man take heed how he builds upon it.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble,<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> The work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one’s work, of what sort it is.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> If anyone’s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward;<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> If anyone’s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Let no one deceive himself; if anyone thinks that he is wise among you in this age, let him become foolish that he may become wise.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written, “He grasps the wise in their craftiness”;<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> And again, “The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> So then let no one boast in men, for all things are yours,<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come; all are yours,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> But you are Christ’s, and Christ is God’s. <br><br>
