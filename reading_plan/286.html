    <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> And immediately in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, and having bound Jesus, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pilate.<br><br>
         <sup><b>2</b></sup> And Pilate questioned Him, Are You the King of the Jews? And answering him, He said, It is as you say.<br><br>
         <sup><b>3</b></sup> And the chief priests accused Him of many things.<br><br>
         <sup><b>4</b></sup> And Pilate again questioned Him, saying, Do You answer nothing? See how many things they are accusing You of.<br><br>
         <sup><b>5</b></sup> But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate marveled.<br><br>
         <sup><b>6</b></sup> Now at the feasts he released to them one prisoner whom they requested.<br><br>
         <sup><b>7</b></sup> And there was one named Barabbas, bound with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the insurrection.<br><br>
         <sup><b>8</b></sup> And the crowd came up and began to ask him to do even as he had been accustomed to do for them.<br><br>
         <sup><b>9</b></sup> But Pilate answered them, saying, Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?<br><br>
         <sup><b>10</b></sup> For he knew that it was because of envy that the chief priests had delivered Him up.<br><br>
         <sup><b>11</b></sup> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd that instead he should release Barabbas to them.<br><br>
         <sup><b>12</b></sup> And Pilate again answered and said to them, What then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?<br><br>
         <sup><b>13</b></sup> And again they cried out, Crucify Him!<br><br>
         <sup><b>14</b></sup> But Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has He done? But they cried out the more, Crucify Him!<br><br>
         <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released to them Barabbas and scourged Jesus and delivered Him up to be crucified.<br><br>
         <sup><b>16</b></sup> And the soldiers led Him away within the courtyard, that is, the praetorium, and called together the whole cohort.<br><br>
         <sup><b>17</b></sup> And they clothed Him in purple and wove a thorny crown and put it around His head.<br><br>
         <sup><b>18</b></sup> And they began to salute Him: Rejoice, King of the Jews!<br><br>
         <sup><b>19</b></sup> And they beat His head with a reed and spat at Him. And kneeling down, they bowed before Him.<br><br>
         <sup><b>20</b></sup> And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple and put His garments on Him. And they led Him out to crucify Him.<br><br>
         <sup><b>21</b></sup> And they compelled a certain passerby coming from the country, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to take up His cross.<br><br>
         <sup><b>22</b></sup> And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is interpreted, the Place of a Skull.<br><br>
         <sup><b>23</b></sup> And they tried to give Him wine mixed with myrrh, but He did not take it.<br><br>
         <sup><b>24</b></sup> And they crucified Him and divided His garments, casting lots for them to see what each should take.<br><br>
         <sup><b>25</b></sup> Now it was the third hour and they crucified Him.<br><br>
         <sup><b>26</b></sup> And there was an inscription of the charge against Him inscribed: THE KING OF THE JEWS.<br><br>
         <sup><b>27</b></sup> And with Him they crucified two robbers, one on His right and one on His left.<br><br>
         <sup><b>28</b></sup> And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And He was counted with the lawless.”<br><br>
         <sup><b>29</b></sup> And those who were passing by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,<br><br>
         <sup><b>30</b></sup> Save Yourself and come down from the cross!<br><br>
         <sup><b>31</b></sup> Likewise also the chief priests with the scribes mocked Him with one another and said, He saved others; Himself He cannot save.<br><br>
         <sup><b>32</b></sup> Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with Him also reproached Him.<br><br>
         <sup><b>33</b></sup> And when the sixth hour came, darkness fell over the whole land until the ninth hour.<br><br>
         <sup><b>34</b></sup> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is interpreted, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?<br><br>
         <sup><b>35</b></sup> And some of those standing by heard this and said, Behold, He is calling for Elijah.<br><br>
         <sup><b>36</b></sup> And someone ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and putting it on a reed, gave it to Him to drink, saying, Let Him be. Let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down.<br><br>
         <sup><b>37</b></sup> And Jesus let out a loud cry and expired.<br><br>
         <sup><b>38</b></sup> And the veil of the temple was split in two from top to bottom.<br><br>
         <sup><b>39</b></sup> And the centurion standing by opposite Him, seeing that He expired in this way, said, Truly this man was the Son of God.<br><br>
         <sup><b>40</b></sup> And there were also some women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of the younger James and of Joses, and Salome,<br><br>
         <sup><b>41</b></sup> Who, when He was in Galilee, followed Him and ministered to Him, as well as many other women who came up with Him to Jerusalem.<br><br>
         <sup><b>42</b></sup> And when evening had fallen, since it was the day of preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,<br><br>
         <sup><b>43</b></sup> Joseph, the honorable member of the Council, from Arimathea, who was also himself awaiting the kingdom of God, came; and gathering courage, he went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.<br><br>
         <sup><b>44</b></sup> And Pilate marveled that He had already died, and calling to him the centurion, he questioned him whether He had been dead long.<br><br>
         <sup><b>45</b></sup> And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.<br><br>
         <sup><b>46</b></sup> And Joseph purchased a piece of fine linen, took Him down, and wrapped Him in the fine linen. And he laid Him in a tomb which was hewn out of rock and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.<br><br>
         <sup><b>47</b></sup> And Mary the Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where He was laid. <br><br>
