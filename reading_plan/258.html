    <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Then some Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,<br><br>
         <sup><b>2</b></sup> Why do Your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.<br><br>
         <sup><b>3</b></sup> And He answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?<br><br>
         <sup><b>4</b></sup> For God said, “Honor your father and your mother,” and, “He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.”<br><br>
         <sup><b>5</b></sup> But you say, Whoever says to his father or his mother, Whatever you would have been profited by me is now a gift to God,<br><br>
         <sup><b>6</b></sup> Shall by no means honor his father or his mother; and you have deprived the word of God of its authority because of your tradition.<br><br>
         <sup><b>7</b></sup> Hypocrites! Well has Isaiah prophesied concerning you, saying,<br><br>
         <sup><b>8</b></sup> “This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart stays far away from Me;<br><br>
         <sup><b>9</b></sup> But in vain do they worship Me, teaching as teachings the commandments of men.”<br><br>
         <sup><b>10</b></sup> And He called the crowd to Him and said to them, Hear and understand:<br><br>
         <sup><b>11</b></sup> It is not that which enters into the mouth that defiles the man; but that which proceeds out of the mouth, this defiles the man.<br><br>
         <sup><b>12</b></sup> Then the disciples came and said to Him, Do You know that the Pharisees were stumbled when they heard this word?<br><br>
         <sup><b>13</b></sup> And He answered and said, Every plant which My heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.<br><br>
         <sup><b>14</b></sup> Let them be. They are blind guides of the blind; and if a blind man guides a blind man, both will fall into a pit.<br><br>
         <sup><b>15</b></sup> And Peter answered and said to Him, Explain this parable to us.<br><br>
         <sup><b>16</b></sup> And He said, Are you also still without understanding?<br><br>
         <sup><b>17</b></sup> Do you not understand that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled into the drain?<br><br>
         <sup><b>18</b></sup> But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man.<br><br>
         <sup><b>19</b></sup> For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies.<br><br>
         <sup><b>20</b></sup> These are the things which defile the man, but eating with unwashed hands does not defile the man.<br><br>
         <sup><b>21</b></sup> And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.<br><br>
         <sup><b>22</b></sup> And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession.<br><br>
         <sup><b>23</b></sup> But He did not answer her a word. And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us.<br><br>
         <sup><b>24</b></sup> But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.<br><br>
         <sup><b>25</b></sup> But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!<br><br>
         <sup><b>26</b></sup> But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.<br><br>
         <sup><b>27</b></sup> And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.<br><br>
         <sup><b>28</b></sup> Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done to you as you wish. And her daughter was healed from that hour.<br><br>
         <sup><b>29</b></sup> And Jesus departed from there and came beside the Sea of Galilee; and He went up to the mountain and sat there.<br><br>
         <sup><b>30</b></sup> And great crowds came to Him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the dumb, and many other sick ones; and they laid them at His feet, and He healed them,<br><br>
         <sup><b>31</b></sup> So that the crowd marveled, because they saw the dumb speaking, the crippled healthy and the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel.<br><br>
         <sup><b>32</b></sup> And Jesus called His disciples to Him and said, I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat. And I am not willing to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.<br><br>
         <sup><b>33</b></sup> And the disciples said to Him, Where can we get so many loaves in this desolate place to satisfy so great a crowd?<br><br>
         <sup><b>34</b></sup> And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? And they said, Seven, and a few small fish.<br><br>
         <sup><b>35</b></sup> And after He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,<br><br>
         <sup><b>36</b></sup> He took the seven loaves and the fish, and giving thanks, He broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.<br><br>
         <sup><b>37</b></sup> And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up what was left over of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.<br><br>
         <sup><b>38</b></sup> And those who ate were four thousand men, apart from women and children.<br><br>
         <sup><b>39</b></sup> And after He sent the crowds away, He stepped into the boat and came to the borders of Magadan.<br><br>
