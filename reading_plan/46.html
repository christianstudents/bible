  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Bear one another’s burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ completely.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> But let each man prove his own work, and then he will have his boast in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For each one shall bear his own load.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But let him who is instructed in the word share in all good things with him who instructs.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Do not be deceived: God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, this he will also reap.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> And let us not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if we do not faint.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> So then, as we have the opportunity, let us do what is good toward all, but especially toward those of the household of the faith.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> As many as desire to make a good show in the flesh, these compel you to be circumcised, but only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For neither do they that become circumcised keep the law themselves, but they desire you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> And as many as walk by this rule, peace be upon them and mercy, even upon the Israel of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. <br><br>
