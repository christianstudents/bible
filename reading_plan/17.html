  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Does any one of you who has a case against another dare to be judged before the unrighteous and not before the saints?<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy of the smallest judgments?<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> Do you not know that we will judge angels, not to mention things of this life?<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> If then you hold judgments over things of this life, do you seat as judges those who are of no account in the church?<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> I say this to your shame. So there is no one wise among you, who will be able to discern between his brothers?<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> But brother goes to court with brother, and this before unbelievers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> Already then it is altogether a defeat to you that you have lawsuits with one another. Why not rather be wronged? Why not rather be defrauded?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> But you wrong and defraud, and this your brothers.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be led astray; neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Nor thieves nor the covetous, not drunkards, not revilers, not the rapacious will inherit the kingdom of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Foods are for the stomach, and the stomach for foods; but God will bring to nought both it and them. But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> And God has both raised up the Lord and will raise us up through His power.<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Absolutely not!<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute is one body? For He says, “The two shall be one flesh.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> Flee fornication. Every sin which a man may do is outside the body, but he who commits fornication sins against his own body.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> For you have been bought with a price. So then glorify God in your body. <br><br>
