  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> But I praise you because in all things you have remembered me and hold fast the things that I have handed down even as I handed them down to you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered disgraces his head.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> But every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head; for it is one and the same as she who is shaved.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For if a woman is not covered, let her hair also be cut off; but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaved, let her be covered.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> For a man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God’s image and glory; but the woman is the glory of the man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> For man is not out of woman, but woman out of man;<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> For also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> Therefore the woman ought to have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of the angels.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> However neither is woman without man, nor man without woman, in the Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> For just as the woman is out from the man, so also is the man through the woman; but all things are out from God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> Judge this in your own selves: Is it fitting for a woman to pray uncovered to God?<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a dishonor to him,<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But if a woman has long hair, it is a glory to her, because her long hair has been given to her for a covering.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> But if anyone seems to be contentious, we do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> But I give you this charge and do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> When therefore you come together in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord’s supper;<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> For in your eating, each one takes his own supper first, and one is hungry and the other is drunk.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and put those to shame who have not? What shall I say to you? Shall I praise you? In this I do not praise you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> For I received from the Lord that which also I delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus in the night in which He was betrayed took bread,<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> And having given thanks, He broke it and said, This is My body, which is given for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> Similarly also the cup after they had dined, saying, This cup is the new covenant established in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you declare the Lord’s death until He comes.<br><br>
     <sup><b>27</b></sup> So then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.<br><br>
     <sup><b>28</b></sup> But let a man prove himself, and in this way let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.<br><br>
     <sup><b>29</b></sup> For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body.<br><br>
     <sup><b>30</b></sup> Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and a number sleep.<br><br>
     <sup><b>31</b></sup> But if we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged.<br><br>
     <sup><b>32</b></sup> But being judged by the Lord, we are disciplined that we may not be condemned with the world.<br><br>
     <sup><b>33</b></sup> So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>34</b></sup> If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, that you may not come together for judgment. And the rest I will set in order when I come. <br><br>
