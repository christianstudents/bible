  <p><sup><b>1</b></sup> It is for freedom that Christ has set us free; stand fast therefore, and do not be entangled with a yoke of slavery again.<br><br>
     <sup><b>2</b></sup> Behold, I Paul say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.<br><br>
     <sup><b>3</b></sup> And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>4</b></sup> You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace.<br><br>
     <sup><b>5</b></sup> For we by the Spirit out of faith eagerly await the hope of righteousness.<br><br>
     <sup><b>6</b></sup> For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith avails, operating through love.<br><br>
     <sup><b>7</b></sup> You were running well. Who hindered you that you would not believe and obey the truth?<br><br>
     <sup><b>8</b></sup> This persuasion is not of Him who calls you.<br><br>
     <sup><b>9</b></sup> A little leaven leavens the whole lump.<br><br>
     <sup><b>10</b></sup> I am confident in the Lord concerning you that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.<br><br>
     <sup><b>11</b></sup> But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? Then the stumbling block of the cross has been annulled.<br><br>
     <sup><b>12</b></sup> I wish that those upsetting you would even cut themselves off.<br><br>
     <sup><b>13</b></sup> For you were called for freedom, brothers; only do not turn this freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>14</b></sup> For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”<br><br>
     <sup><b>15</b></sup> But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another.<br><br>
     <sup><b>16</b></sup> But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.<br><br>
     <sup><b>17</b></sup> For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire.<br><br>
     <sup><b>18</b></sup> But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>19</b></sup> And the works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,<br><br>
     <sup><b>20</b></sup> Idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects,<br><br>
     <sup><b>21</b></sup> Envyings, bouts of drunkenness, carousings, and things like these, of which I tell you beforehand, even as I have said before, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.<br><br>
     <sup><b>22</b></sup> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,<br><br>
     <sup><b>23</b></sup> Meekness, self-control; against such things there is no law.<br><br>
     <sup><b>24</b></sup> But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts.<br><br>
     <sup><b>25</b></sup> If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.<br><br>
     <sup><b>26</b></sup> Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another. <br><br>
